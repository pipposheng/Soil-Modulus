# Soil-Modulus
This is the Soil Modulus Regression Model for Pavement Subgrade in Florida.

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a linear regression model for the resilient modulus of pavement subgrade for the Florida Soils. Several parameters include the soil density, moisture content, limerock bearing ratio, Coefficient of Uniformity, Coefficient of Curvature, and fine content in the soil. The model can be applied in the design guide for the future pavement design and construction.

Linear regression models were developed for the soils with different classification. A combined model was also developed. The R-package Applied Linear Regression 3rd Edition was used. The factors with significant effect were included in the model. Some required power transformation was also made, while the modulus data is transformed to log scale.
