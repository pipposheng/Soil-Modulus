# Soil-Modulus
This is the Soil Modulus Regression Model for Pavement Subgrade in Florida using Linear Regression Analysis.

The resilient modulus of pavement subgrade is an essential engineering parameter
for the mechanistic-empirical pavement design. Resilient modulus of subgrade is
significantly influenced by the physical properties of subgrade materials. In view of the
complexity and difficulty in conducting the resilient modulus measurement, establishing
resilient modulus correlation models based on the physical properties of subgrade soil has
increasingly become necessary. This project presents an extensive study to develop
compacted subgrade resilient modulus correlation models using multiple regression
analysis for two types of commonly available granular subgrade materials in Florida: fine
sand (A-3 soil) and silty/clayey sand (A-2-4 soil). In this study, eight influencing
parameters were available for selection in the resilient modulus database: moisture
content, dry unit weight, percent of fines, percent of clay content, CBR, coefficient of
curvature (CC), uniformity coefficient (CU), and permeability. The eight parameters were
evaluated employing the backward stepwise multiple regression with the criteria of α =
0.05 to obtain a useful subset of the predictors. Three stepwise regressions, the A-3
model, the A-2-4 model, and the combined A-3 and A-2-4 model, were considered for
the A-3 soils, the A-2-4 soils, and the A-3 and A-2-4 soils, respectively. The model
variables were selected according to the importance of the influencing parameters as
indicated by the stepwise analysis and the experimental results. The logarithm values of
the resilient modulus measurements were chosen as the model response. The usability of
the model was then checked through the analysis of a variance F-test.

The final models for the soil modulus are: 
A-2-4 Soil: log(Mr) = 4.964 − 0.0597Cc + 0.0124Cu + 0.0333Clay − 0.0479MC
A-3 Soil: Mr =124.43 − 29.65Cc + 3.92log(LBR) − 0.059MC^2
Combined model: log(Mr) = 4.945 − 0.05231Cc + 0.01144Cu − 0.0284MC

The proposed correlation models would achieve a reasonably estimated resilient
modulus value within an error of ±20%. The regression analyses indicated that a safety
factor should be applied to adjust the estimated resilient modulus for practical
applications. A resilient modulus value with 20% lower than the estimated value from the
proposed correlation model should be considered for estimating the resilient modulus of
subgrade materials for the pavement design applications.
